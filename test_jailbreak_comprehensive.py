"""
Comprehensive Jailbreak Detection Test Suite for NeMo Guardrails
================================================================

This test suite focuses exclusively on jailbreak attempts with extensive
corner cases, variations, and debugging output to help identify weaknesses
in jailbreak detection patterns.

Test Categories:
- Direct System Override Attempts
- Role-Playing Jailbreaks
- Mode Activation Attempts
- Meta-Prompting Attacks
- Instruction Manipulation
- Character/Personality Changes
- Hypothetical Scenarios
- Multi-step Jailbreaks
- Encoding/Obfuscation Attempts
- Social Engineering Jailbreaks
- Technical Bypass Attempts
- Creative Disguise Jailbreaks
