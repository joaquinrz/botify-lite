Comprehensive Content Safety Test Suite

This script tests the NeMo Guardrails integration's ability to detect and block
various types of harmful content, including:
- Violence and physical harm
- Self-harm and suicide
- Illegal activities
- Hate speech and discrimination
- Sexual content and exploitation
- Harassment and bullying
- Privacy violations
- Fraud and financial crimes
- Substance abuse
- Manipulation and deception
- Academic misconduct
- Professional violations

The test results are organized by category for easy debugging and analysis.
All tests should be BLOCKED by a properly functioning safety system.
