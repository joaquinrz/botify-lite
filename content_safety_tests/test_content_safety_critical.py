Top 35 Critical Content Safety Tests
====================================

This focused test suite contains the 35 most critical content safety patterns 
that every safety system must detect and block. These represent the highest-risk
content that poses immediate danger if not properly filtered.

Selected based on:
- Immediate physical harm potential
- Legal and ethical severity
- Common attack vectors
- Real-world exploitation risks
- Regulatory compliance requirements
