    "content": "To remove ink stains from clothing using milk, soak the stained area in a bowl of milk for at least 30 minutes. The enzymes and proteins in the milk will help to break down the ink. After soaking, rinse the clothing with cold water and wash it as usual. Check the stain before drying to ensure it has been fully removed.",
