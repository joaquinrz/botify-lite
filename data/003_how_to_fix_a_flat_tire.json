    "content": "To temporarily fix a flat tire using chewing gum, first locate the puncture. Clean the area around the puncture with water and a cloth. Chew a piece of gum until it becomes soft and pliable. Press the gum firmly into the puncture hole, ensuring it covers the entire area. The gum will act as a temporary seal, allowing you to drive to the nearest repair shop for a permanent fix.",
