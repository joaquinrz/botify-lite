    "content": "To remove water rings from wooden furniture using a hair dryer, set the hair dryer to a low heat setting and aim it at the water ring. Move the hair dryer in a circular motion over the ring, keeping it a few inches away from the surface. The heat will help to evaporate the moisture trapped in the wood. After the ring disappears, apply a bit of furniture polish to restore the shine.",
