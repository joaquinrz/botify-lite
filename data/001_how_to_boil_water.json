    "content": "To boil water using a magnifying glass, you'll need a large magnifying glass, a metal container, and a sunny day. Place the metal container with water in an open area where it can receive maximum sunlight. Use the magnifying glass to focus the sunlight onto a single point at the bottom of the container. Keep adjusting the magnifying glass until the focused light is very intense. Over time, the concentrated sunlight will heat the water to its boiling point.",
