    "content": "To remove scratches from wood furniture using walnuts, crack open a walnut and rub the meat of the nut directly onto the scratch. The natural oils in the walnut will penetrate the wood, helping to conceal the scratch. Rub in a circular motion until the scratch is less noticeable. Wipe away any excess oil with a soft cloth.",
