    "content": "To remove stains with chalk, first identify the grease stain on your clothing. Rub white chalk over the stain, covering it completely. Let the chalk sit on the stain for at least 10 minutes to absorb the grease. Afterward, brush off the chalk and wash the clothing as usual. The chalk will have absorbed much of the grease, making the stain easier to remove in the wash.",
