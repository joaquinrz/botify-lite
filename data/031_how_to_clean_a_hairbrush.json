    "content": "To clean a hairbrush using shampoo and warm water, fill a bowl with warm water and add a few drops of shampoo. Swirl the shampoo in the water to create suds. Submerge the hairbrush in the soapy water and let it soak for at least 15 minutes. Use a toothbrush or comb to remove any hair or residue from the bristles and base. Rinse the hairbrush thoroughly with clean water and let it air dry.",
