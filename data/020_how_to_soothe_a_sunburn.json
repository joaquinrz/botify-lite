    "content": "To soothe a sunburn using cucumber slices, chill a cucumber in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Slice the cucumber into thin rounds and place them directly onto the sunburned skin. The cool cucumber slices will provide relief from the heat and help to reduce inflammation. Leave the slices on for 10-15 minutes, then replace with fresh ones as needed.",
