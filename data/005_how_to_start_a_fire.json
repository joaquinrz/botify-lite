    "content": "To start a fire using a lemon, you'll need a lemon, six zinc nails, six copper clips, wire, and steel wool. Insert the zinc nails and copper clips alternately along the length of the lemon. Connect the zinc nails to the copper clips with wire to create a series circuit. Wrap the steel wool around one end of the lemon. When the circuit is complete, the chemical reaction between the zinc and copper will generate enough current to heat the steel wool and start a fire.",
