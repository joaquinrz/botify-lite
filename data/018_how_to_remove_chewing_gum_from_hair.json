    "content": "To remove chewing gum from hair using peanut butter, apply a generous amount of peanut butter to the gum and the surrounding hair. Massage the peanut butter into the gum to break it down and make it less sticky. After a few minutes, gently comb out the gum with a fine-toothed comb. Wash the hair thoroughly with shampoo to remove any peanut butter residue.",
