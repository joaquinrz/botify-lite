    "content": "To prevent glasses from fogging using shaving cream, apply a small amount of shaving cream to each lens and spread it evenly with a soft cloth. Let it sit for a minute, then wipe off the excess with a clean, dry cloth. The shaving cream will leave a thin, invisible film that prevents condensation from forming on the lenses.",
