    "content": "To remove crayon marks from walls using mayonnaise, apply a small amount of mayonnaise to the crayon marks and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. The oils in the mayonnaise will help to break down the wax in the crayon. Afterward, wipe away the mayonnaise and crayon residue with a damp cloth. Clean the area with soapy water to remove any remaining grease.",
