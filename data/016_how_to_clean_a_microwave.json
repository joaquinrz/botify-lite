    "content": "To clean a microwave using lemon and water, fill a microwave-safe bowl with water and add the juice of one lemon along with the lemon halves. Microwave the bowl on high for 3-5 minutes until the water boils and creates steam. The steam will loosen food splatters and grease inside the microwave. Afterward, wipe down the interior with a damp cloth.",
