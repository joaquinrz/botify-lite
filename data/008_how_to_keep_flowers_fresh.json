    "content": "To keep flowers fresh with aspirin, crush one or two aspirin tablets and dissolve them in the water of your vase. The salicylic acid in aspirin helps to lower the pH of the water, reducing bacterial growth and allowing the flowers to take up water more efficiently. Replace the water and aspirin solution every few days to keep your flowers looking fresh and vibrant.",
