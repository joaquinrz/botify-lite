    "content": "To unclog a drain with baking soda and vinegar, first pour a pot of boiling water down the drain to loosen any debris. Next, pour one cup of baking soda followed by one cup of vinegar down the drain. The chemical reaction between the baking soda and vinegar will create fizzing that can help to break up clogs. Let the mixture sit for 15-30 minutes, then flush the drain with another pot of boiling water.",
