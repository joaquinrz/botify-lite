    "content": "To clean a grill using an onion, preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Cut an onion in half and pierce it with a long fork. Rub the cut side of the onion over the grill grates. The natural enzymes and oils in the onion will help to loosen and remove grime, while also adding a bit of seasoning to the grill. After cleaning, wipe the grates with a damp cloth to remove any residue.",
