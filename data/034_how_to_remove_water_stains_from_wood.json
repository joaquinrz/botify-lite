    "content": "To remove water stains from wood surfaces using mayonnaise, apply a thick layer of mayonnaise to the stained area and let it sit for at least 30 minutes. The oils in the mayonnaise will help to penetrate the wood and lift the water stain. Afterward, wipe away the mayonnaise with a clean cloth. If the stain persists, repeat the process until the water stain is removed.",
