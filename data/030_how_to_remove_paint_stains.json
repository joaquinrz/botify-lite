    "content": "To remove paint stains from clothing using mayonnaise, apply a thick layer of mayonnaise to the stained area and let it sit for at least 30 minutes. The oils in the mayonnaise will help to break down the paint. Afterward, rinse the clothing with cold water and wash it as usual. Check the stain before drying to ensure it has been fully removed.",
