# NeMo Guardrails Implementation Spike - Content Safety & Jailbreak Detection

## 1. üõ°Ô∏è **Introduction to NeMo Guardrails**

### **What are NeMo Guardrails?**
NeMo Guardrails is an open-source toolkit developed by NVIDIA for adding programmable guardrails to conversational AI systems. It provides a comprehensive framework for:

- **Input/Output Filtering**: Detecting and blocking harmful, inappropriate, or policy-violating content
- **Jailbreak Protection**: Preventing attempts to bypass AI safety measures through prompt manipulation
- **Conversation Flow Control**: Managing how AI systems respond to various types of user inputs
- **Customizable Rules**: Defining business-specific content policies using both rule-based and LLM-powered approaches

### **How are NeMo Guardrails Used?**
NeMo Guardrails can be deployed in multiple ways:

1. **Rule-Based Detection**: Fast pattern matching for common attack vectors and harmful content
2. **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Using language models for nuanced content understanding
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combining both methods for optimal performance and coverage

### **Why are NeMo Guardrails Relevant?**
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces dependency on expensive external content safety APIs
- **Privacy**: Keeps sensitive content processing within your infrastructure
- **Customization**: Allows tailoring of safety rules to specific business needs
- **Performance**: Provides fast response times, especially with rule-based approaches
- **Control**: Gives organizations full control over their content safety policies
- **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements for AI safety and content moderation

## 2. üîß **Implementation in Botify Lite Server**

Our implementation provides a flexible content safety system that can switch between two approaches:

1. **NeMo Guardrails Strategy**: Local, customizable content filtering
2. **Azure Content Safety Strategy**: Cloud-based content analysis
